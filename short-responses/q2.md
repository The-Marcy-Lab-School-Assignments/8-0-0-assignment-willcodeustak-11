# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

An endpoint in express is the unique path in the URL.

An endpoint in Express is like a specific address in your app where a certain action happens(that you created for example component pages).

For example, if you go to /api/users, that might show you a list of users.

The endpoint tells the app what to do when someone visits that address, like showing data or saving new information.
