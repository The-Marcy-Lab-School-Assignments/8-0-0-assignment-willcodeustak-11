# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer

The controller is like a set of instructions or conditions
that runs when someone accesses that specific path. It determines what the server does next, such as fetching data, processing input, or sending a response back to the user.
